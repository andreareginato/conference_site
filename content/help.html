<h3>Help us as a volunteer <small>(Ruby mastery not required)</small></h3>
<p class="section">
  As you may know, a great event requires a great deal of work. As a volunteer you can help with attendees registration, assistance and video recordings. Don't worry for your favourite talks, send your preferences at <a href="mailto:info@rubyday.it">info@rubyday.it</a> and you should still be able to follow them ;)

<h3>Spread the word.</h3>
<p class="section">
  Make sure your friends, collegues and classmates won't miss the appointment: let them know about us on twitter, facebook, blog&hellip;
