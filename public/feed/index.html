    <title type="html">Home automation: experts' point of view</title>
    <published>2011-12-12T23:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2011-12-12T23:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://lelylan.com/blog/experts/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="article"&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Our latest &lt;a href="/blog/sucks"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; explained why home automation does not work today,
    at least for us. The article was deliberately provoking, and we received numerous feedback. 
    Some was good, some not, but all of them taught us something. 
    In this article we decided to sum up some of the most interesting thoughts, to remember
    how some experts are approaching home automation.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4&gt;Group #1. Home automation is my precious.&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;div class="row"&gt;
      &lt;div class="span6"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          I Don't think Automation Sucks. &lt;/br&gt;
          I think Automation is exactly where it should be. &lt;/br&gt;
          Otherwise the costs would drop, the profits would &lt;/br&gt;
          follow and the work load would increase...
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;small&gt;Mr. Gollum&lt;/small&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="span3"&gt;
        &lt;ul class="media-grid"&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;a href="#"&gt;
              &lt;img class="thumbnail" src="/images/blog/experts/1.png" alt=""&gt;
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    For some experts the main goal is profit. They do not care about user experience, 
    services or innovation. They only care about themselves. Their perfect world is 
    the one where everything is closed and under their control, so they can become rich.
    They are the winners, absolutely. 
  &lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;h4&gt;Group #2. Homeowners are a nightmare.&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;div class="row"&gt;
      &lt;div class="span6"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          As long as you are dealing with "A Home Owner" you get comments such as; 
          "it's too big", it's too small", it's too fat", it's too thin", "it 
          looks funny", "I can't read the text", "isn't there a different 
          color", "why doesn't it do everything"...
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;small&gt;Mr. Nightmare&lt;/small&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="span3"&gt;
        &lt;ul class="media-grid"&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;a href="#"&gt;
              &lt;img class="thumbnail" src="/images/blog/experts/2.png" alt=""&gt;
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    I think this problem arise when you lack on two basic things. 
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;Know what you do&lt;/strong&gt;. Know your 
        sector and the solutions you can offer. If you don't, clients will start
        asking for any possible idea they have in mind. 
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;strong&gt;Start by saying no&lt;/strong&gt;. The secret of getting half a product instead 
        of a half-ass product is &lt;a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch05_Start_With_No.php"&gt;
        saying no&lt;/a&gt;. If people complain when you don't adopt 
        their ideas, remind them why they liked the home automation system you 
        proposed in the first place. I know this is not easy, but it will pay back.
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;


  
  &lt;h4&gt;Group #3. You can not play with me, you are not smart.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;div class="row"&gt;
      &lt;div class="span6"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          Home automation needs a lot of time, effort and knowledge 
          and it's a challenge where not everyone fit out if you have 
          not the technical knowledge, pragmatic sensibility to deal 
          with end-users and a strong project management skills...
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;small&gt;Mr. Smart&lt;/small&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="span3"&gt;
        &lt;ul class="media-grid"&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;a href="#"&gt;
              &lt;img class="thumbnail" src="/images/blog/experts/3.png" alt=""&gt;
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    I didn't know home automation was like getting a degree in astrophysics. For sure
    home automation is not like playing with Lego (not yet) but if we keep making home
    automation something so difficult to use, we will never see a connected house in our lives. 
    Wouldn't be better if every single person who has a specific knowledge could improve 
    domotics? We &lt;a href="/collaborations/"&gt;think so&lt;/a&gt;.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    Of course, there were other answers making up other groups, even interesting 
    ones, however, these were the ones that made us think the most. It seems that 
    most experts in the field of home automation have a limited way of thinking, 
    referring only to the existing market. Our dream, the birth of a home 
    automation system that is open for everyone, appears to be far this way, and
    this is the reason we are here, a passionate need to change the rules.
  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">Why home automation sucks</title>
    <published>2011-11-17T23:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2011-11-17T23:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://lelylan.com/blog/sucks/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="article"&gt;

  &lt;ul class="media-grid"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;a href="/collaborations/"&gt;
        &lt;img class="thumbnail" src="/images/blog/sucks.png" alt=""&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    When we talk about Lelylan, most of the people just tell us that domotics 
    already exists.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    As we try to enjoy our time around, we reply with a simple question: &lt;strong&gt;how many 
    of you have a domotics system, today&lt;/strong&gt;? The answer is always the same, nobody. 
    To highlight this, it was fun when during a presentation in front of almost 
    100 people just one hand raised up, clarifying that his domotics system didn't 
    really work.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    It's true, lots of companies have been working on home automation for many 
    years. Some of them are well-known names like
    &lt;a href="http://www.crestron.com/"&gt;Creston&lt;/a&gt;, 
    &lt;a href="http://control4.com"&gt;Control4&lt;/a&gt; and
    &lt;a href="http://www.amx.com"&gt;AMX&lt;/a&gt;, 
    but there is no real market. As there are so few domotics houses, this field looks like
    a dream for many of us. At this point, the correct question is: 
    &lt;strong&gt;why home automation sucks so much nowadays!?&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    People tend to think that the cause for the low domotics penetration is 
    price. This is both true and false. Actual domotics systems 
    are quite expensive, but like all technologies, when they start to spread,
    costs start to get lower and lower. So why, why home automation is not a reality?
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;The real problem are the existing domotics companies&lt;/strong&gt;. 
    They create devices that are not able to speak to each other, trying in this way 
    to keep their market share.  
    The consequences are the impossibility for devices such as lights, appliances, 
    security and alarm systems, gas and smoke sensors, multimedia systems, heating 
    systems to communicate with each other, higher complexities, fewer services, 
    higher prices and more importantly lot of confusion for the final user.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    Thinking at home automation as companies do today, will not last long. 
    &lt;a href="http://www.lelylan.com/blog/why"&gt;Lelylan&lt;/a&gt; and 
    new Internet of Things related &lt;a href="http://postscapes.com/companies"&gt;Companies&lt;/a&gt;
    will change the way we think at home automation.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Let everyone experiment new services, remove complexities, make devices 
      communicate and teach people what home automation really means.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;small&gt;Mr. Lelylan&lt;/small&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    If you think home automation sucks, &lt;a href="/collaborations/"&gt;join us now&lt;/a&gt;. 
    We envision a future where our houses will be the ones we have dreamed when we where 
    child. Don't you love this?

    <title type="html">What the hell does #IoT means?</title>
    <published>2011-11-02T23:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2011-11-02T23:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://lelylan.com/blog/iot/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="article"&gt;

  &lt;ul class="media-grid"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;a href="#"&gt;
        &lt;img class="thumbnail" src="/images/blog/iot.png" alt=""&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    The Internet of Things is a concept, a cool one I would say. The problem is that people 
    love to complicate things. Thus, there are 
    &lt;a href="http://postscapes.com/internet-of-things-definition"&gt;different definitions&lt;/a&gt; 
    describing this concept. Conclusion? Just a "little" confusion, making the Internet of 
    Things a concept trying to describe everything, and consequently resulting in nothing.
    But let's take a step back. What the hell does Internet of Things mean?
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/br&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;A world where physical things are reflected onto the web&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/br&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    This is the final definition we came up with. It apparently does not say too much, right? 
    Well, not really. It completely describes the concept in all its simplicity. So, why this 
    simple concept is so exciting? Because the #IoT power comes out from the combination of the 
    physical objects which can affect the real world, and the web which is the fastest growing 
    technology platform available today. Just two concepts, but two really powerful ones, that 
    combined can definitely change our lives. 
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    Think about the web as it is today. Lot of services, mashups, developers and new ideas popping 
    up every day. Now, apply all of this to the Internet of Things and try to imagine all the 
    possible new solutions. Smart meters, smart cities and smart houses are only some of them.
  &lt;/p&gt;  

  &lt;p&gt;
    Still, I've many doubts. First, I keep reading the word “smart” too many times, and I think 
    there is little smart in the #IoT right now. Second, the #IoT is for sure a nice concept, and 
    I love the idea behind it, but I can't really trust something that can do "everything", just 
    because there is nothing like that. 
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    Our personal opinion is that we don't have to start from the #IoT to make it successful. We 
    must start from some of its real applications, building new services on top of it. The one 
    we bet on is the Connected House, but there are lot more out there. Just find the one you 
    love the most and make the Internet of Things real.
    And for you, what's the #IoT?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    If you want to learn more about #IoT you should read 
    &lt;a href="http://postscapes.com"&gt;postscapes&lt;/a&gt; and check out some articles on 
    &lt;a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/internet_of_things_explained_video_intro.php"&gt;ReadWriteWeb&lt;/a&gt;,

    <published>2011-10-15T22:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2011-10-15T22:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://lelylan.com/blog/why/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="article"&gt;

  &lt;ul class="media-grid"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;a href="#"&gt;
        &lt;img class="thumbnail" src="/images/blog/why.png" alt=""&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Lelylan is a project called to life by the need of solving technological limitations that 
    home automation (aka domotics) is facing today.
    Nowadays our houses are furnished with numerous devices like appliances, lighting systems, 
    alarms, irrigation systems, smoke and gas detectors, heating, cooling, audio, video systems 
    and much more. There is only a problem, well, a big problem: those devices use different 
    standards and they can't easily communicate with each other.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Lelylan has 3 goals&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Connect your house to the web with a clear and simple set of web services.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Enable all devices to communicate with each other.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Allow everybody to create new services on top of Lelylan, so that we can speed 
          up innovation in this field.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    To make the concept clear, let's think at some of the most important web services available 
    today, like Facebook and Twitter. They offer APIs to access our social graph or our micro 
    blogging data. In the same way, Lelylan wants to define a set of simple, clear and consistent
    APIs to access all resources interacting with your house through the web.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    What we aim to do is to map every device to a unique URI which will provide control over it. 
    When such a connection is done, technological limitations disappear and devices become 
    identifiable only through their functionalities.
  &lt;/p&gt;  

  &lt;p&gt;
    For the first time you have a real chance to change how home automation works. If you are one 
    of those crazy innovators, &lt;a href="/collaborations/"&gt;write us about your ideas&lt;/a&gt;.
  &lt;/p&gt;
