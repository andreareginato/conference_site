      RESULTING FROM (i) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES;

    </p>

    <h3>Exclusions</h3>
    <p>
      Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the exclusion or

      may not apply to you.
    </p>

    <h3>Waiver and Severability</h3>
    <p>
      The failure of Lelylan to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be 
      deemed a waiver of such right or provision. In the event that any provision of these 
      Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of these Terms 
      will remain in full force and effect.
    </p>

    <h3>Controlling Law and Jurisdiction</h3>

      state or country of residence. All claims, legal proceedings or litigation arising in 
      connection with the Services will be brought solely in San Francisco County, California, 
      and you consent to the jurisdiction of and venue in such courts and waive any objection as 
      to inconvenient forum. If you are accepting these Terms on behalf of a United States 
      federal government entity that is legally unable to accept the controlling law, 
      jurisdiction or venue clauses above, then those clauses do not apply to you but instead 
      these Terms and any action related thereto will be will be governed by the laws of the 
      United States of America (without reference to conflict of laws) and, in the absence of 
      federal law and to the extent permitted under federal law, the laws of the State of

    <p>
      These Terms, the Lelylan Rules and our Privacy Policy are the entire and exclusive 
      agreement between Lelylan and you regarding the Services (excluding any services for 
      which you have a separate agreement with Lelylan that is explicitly in addition or 
      in place of these Terms), and these Terms supersede and replace any prior agreements 
      between Lelylan and you regarding the Services. Other than members of the group of 
      companies of which Lelylan is the parent, no other person or company will be third party 
      beneficiaries to the Terms.

      We may revise these Terms from time to time, the most current version will always be at 
      <a href="/tos/">www.lelylan.com/tos</a>. If the revision, in our sole discretion, is material
